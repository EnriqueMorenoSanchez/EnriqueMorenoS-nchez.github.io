            <p>Astronomy, science that encompasses the study of all extraterrestrial objects and phenomena. Until the invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century, astronomy was primarily concerned with noting and predicting the positions of the Sun,
            Moon, and planets, originally for calendrical and astrological purposes and later for navigational uses and scientific interest. The catalog of objects now studied is much broader and includes, in order of increasing distance, the solar system, the stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy, and
            other, more distant galaxies. With the advent of scientific space probes, Earth also has come to be studied as one of the planets, though its more-detailed investigation remains the domain of the Earth sciences.</p>

            <img id="img2" src="images/IMGBIN_earth-globe-world-planet-astronomy-png_tH6Pr0BL.png" width="550px" height="600px">
            <p>Since the late 19th century, astronomy has expanded to include astrophysics, the application of physical and chemical knowledge to an understanding of the nature of celestial objects and the physical processes that control their formation, evolution, and emission of radiation.
            Gases and dust particles around stars became the subjects of much research. Study of the nuclear reactions that provide the energy radiated by stars has shown how the diversity of atoms found in nature can be derived from a universe that, following the first few minutes
            of its existence, consisted only of hydrogen and helium. Concerned with phenomena on the largest scale is cosmology, the study of the evolution of the universe. Astrophysics has transformed cosmology from a purely speculative activity to a modern science capable of predictions
            that can be tested.<br>
            Its great advances notwithstanding, astronomy is still subject to a major constraint: it is inherently an observational rather than an experimental science.
            In future, space missions may return surface materials from Mars, or other objects, but much of
            astronomy appears otherwise confined to Earth-based observations augmented by observations from orbiting satellites and long-range space probes supplemented by theory.</p>

        <div id="div3"><h2 id="Selection3">Study of the solar system</h2>

            <p>The solar system took shape 4.57 billion years ago, when it condensed within a large cloud of gas and dust. Gravitational attraction holds the planets in their elliptical orbits around the Sun. In addition to Earth, five major planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) have been known
            from ancient times. Since then only two more have been discovered: Uranus by accident in 1781 and Neptune in 1846 after a deliberate search following a theoretical prediction based on observed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Pluto, discovered in 1930 after a search for a planet predicted to
            lie beyond Neptune, was considered a major planet until 2006, when it was redesignated a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.<br>
            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, while Neptune is the farthest. Pluto’s orbit is sufficiently eccentric that at times it is closer to the Sun than is Neptune.                   
            Most of the mass of the solar system is concentrated in the Sun. Together, all of the planets amount to 2.7 × 1030 grams, and Jupiter alone accounts for 71 percent of this amount. The solar system also contains five known
            objects of intermediate size classified as dwarf planets and a very large number of much smaller objects collectively called small bodies. The small bodies, roughly in order of decreasing size, are the asteroids, or minor planets; comets, including Kuiper belt, Centaur, and Oort cloud objects;
            meteoroids; and interplanetary dust particles. Because of their starlike appearance when discovered, the largest of these bodies were termed asteroids, and that name is widely used, but, now that the rocky nature of these bodies is understood, their more descriptive name is minor planets.
            The surfaces of the terrestrial planets and many satellites show extensive cratering, produced by high-speed impacts. On Earth, with its large quantities of water and an active atmosphere, many of these cosmic footprints have eroded, but remnants of very large craters can be
            seen in aerial and spacecraft photographs of the terrestrial surface. On Mercury, Mars, and the Moon, the absence of water and any significant atmosphere has left the craters unchanged for billions of years, apart from disturbances produced by infrequent later impacts. Volcanic activity has been an
            important force in the shaping of the surfaces of the Moon and the terrestrial planets. Seismic activity on the Moon has been monitored by means of seismometers left on its surface by Apollo astronauts and by Lunokhod robotic rovers. Cratering on the largest scale seems to have ceased about three
            billion years ago, although on the Moon there is clear evidence for a continued cosmic drizzle of small particles, with the larger objects churning (“gardening”) the lunar surface and the smallest producing microscopic impact pits in crystals in the lunar rocks.<br>
            All of the planets apart from the two closest to the Sun (Mercury and Venus) have natural satellites (moons) that are very diverse in appearance, size, and structure, as revealed in close-up observations from long-range space probes. The four outer dwarf planets have moons; Pluto has at least five
            moons, including one, Charon, fully half the size of Pluto itself. Over 200 asteroids and 80 Kuiper belt objects also have moons. Four planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), one dwarf planet (Haumea), and one Centaur object (Chariklo) have rings, disklike systems of small rocks and particles
            that orbit their parent bodies.</p>
            
            <div id="div3extra"><h2 id="Selection3.1">Lunar exploration</h2>

                <p>During the U.S. Apollo missions a total weight of 381.7 kg of lunar material was collected; an additional 300 grams was brought back by unmanned Soviet Luna vehicles. About 15 percent of the Apollo samples have been distributed for analysis, with the remainder stored at
                the NASA. The opportunity to employ a wide range of laboratory techniques on these lunar samples has revolutionized planetary science. The results of the analyses have enabled investigators to determine the composition and age of the lunar surface. Seismic
                observations have made it possible to probe the lunar interior. In addition, retroreflectors left on the Moon’s surface by Apollo astronauts have allowed high-power laser beams to be sent from Earth to the Moon and back, permitting scientists to monitor the Earth-Moon distance to an accuracy of a few
                centimetres. This experiment, which has provided data used in calculations of the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, has shown that the separation of the two bodies is increasing by 4.4 cm each year.</p>

                <h2 id="Selection3.2">Planetary studies</h2>

                <p>Mercury is too hot to retain an atmosphere, but Venus’s brilliant white appearance is the result of its being completely enveloped in thick clouds of carbon dioxide, impenetrable at visible wavelengths. Below the upper clouds, Venus has a hostile atmosphere containing clouds of sulfuric acid droplets.
                The cloud cover shields the planet’s surface from direct sunlight, but the energy that does filter through warms the surface, which then radiates at infrared wavelengths. In contrast, the atmosphere of Mars is very thin and is composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95 percent), with very little water vapour; the planet’s surface pressure is
                only about 0.006 that of Earth. The outer planets have atmospheres composed largely of light gases, mainly hydrogen and helium.</p>
                <img id="img5" src="images/Infographic.png" width=1250px>
                <p>Each planet rotates on its axis, and nearly all of them rotate in the same direction. The two exceptions are Venus, which rotates in the clockwise direction beneath its cloud cover, and Uranus, which has its rotation axis very nearly in the plane of the ecliptic.
                Some of the planets have magnetic fields. Earth’s field extends outward until it is disturbed by the solar wind which carries a magnetic field along with it. Particles from the solar wind and galactic cosmic rays
                populate two doughnut-shaped regions called the Van Allen radiation belts. In these belts,
                trapped particles spiral along paths that take them around Earth while bouncing back and forth between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with their orbits controlled by Earth’s magnetic field. During periods of increased solar activity, these regions of trapped particles are disturbed, and some of the
                particles move down into Earth’s atmosphere, where they collide with atoms and molecules to produce auroras.
                Jupiter has a magnetic field far stronger than Earth’s and many more trapped electrons, whose synchrotron radiation is detectable from Earth. Bursts of increased
                radio emission are correlated with the position of Io, the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. Saturn has a magnetic field that is much weaker than Jupiter’s, but it too has a region of trapped particles. Mercury has a weak magnetic field that is only about 1 percent as strong as Earth’s and shows no
                evidence of trapped particles. Uranus and Neptune have fields that are less than one-tenth the strength of Saturn’s and appear much more complex than that of Earth. No field has been detected around Venus or Mars.</p>

            <p>Cosmology is the scientific study of the universe as a unified whole, from its earliest moments through its evolution to its ultimate fate. The currently accepted cosmological model is the big bang. In this picture, the expansion of the universe started in an intense explosion 13.8 billion years ago. In this primordial fireball,
            the temperature exceeded one trillion K, and most of the energy was in the form of radiation. As the expansion proceeded (accompanied by cooling), the role of the radiation diminished, and other physical processes dominated in turn. Thus, after about three minutes, the temperature had dropped to the one-billion-K range, making it
            possible for nuclear reactions of protons to take place and produce nuclei of deuterium and helium. With further expansion, the time between nuclear collisions had increased and the proportion of deuterium and
            helium nuclei had stabilized. After a few hundred thousand years, the temperature must have dropped sufficiently for electrons to remain attached to nuclei to constitute atoms. Galaxies are thought to have begun forming after a few million years. Star formation probably started much later,
            after at least a billion years, and the process continues today.</p>

            <p>Observational support for this general model comes from several independent directions. The expansion has been documented by the redshifts observed in the spectra of galaxies. Furthermore, the radiation left over from the original fireball would have cooled with the expansion. Confirmation of this relic energy came in 1965 with one of
            the most striking cosmic discoveries of the 20th century—the observation, at short radio wavelengths, of a widespread cosmic radiation corresponding to a temperature of almost 3 K. The shape of the observed spectrum is an excellent fit with the theoretical Planck blackbody spectrum. The spectrum of this cosmic radio noise peaks at 
            approximately a one-millimetre wavelength, which is in the far infrared, a difficult region to observe from Earth; however, the spectrum has been well mapped by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, and Planck satellites.</p>
